# US 15 - Overview of all the tests performed by Many Labs and analyse the overall performance of the company

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

* As a laboratory coordinator, I want to have an overview of all the tests performed by Many Labs and analyse the overall performance of the company.*  

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

From the Specifications Document:
* To evaluate this, it proceeds as following: for
  any interval of time, for example one week (6 working days with 12 working hours per day), the
  difference between the number of new tests and the number of results available to the client during
  each half an hour period is computed. In that case, a list with 144 integers is obtained, where a
  positive integer means that in such half an hour more tests were processed than results were
  obtained, and a negative integer means the opposite. Now, the problem consists in determining what
  the contiguous subsequence of the initial sequence is, whose sum of their entries is maximum. This
  will show the time interval, in such week, when the company was less effective in responding. So,
  the application should implement a brute-force algorithm (an algorithm which examines each
  subsequence) to determine the contiguous subsequence with maximum sum, for any interval of time
  registered. The implemented algorithm should be analysed in terms of its worst-case time
  complexity, and it should be compared to a provided benchmark algorithm. The algorithm to be
  used by the application must be defined through a configuration file.

From the client clarifications:

* > Q:What is the total number of tests processed in the laboratory? Is it the number of tests that were given results in that time span or is it the number of tests that were validated in that time span?

* >  A: The total number of tests processed in the laboratory is the total number of tests that were validated by the laboratory coordinator.
  In a previous answer I asked: "The laboratory coordinator should be able to check the number of clients, the number of tests waiting for results, the number of tests waiting for diagnosis and the total number of tests processed in the laboratory in each day, week, month and year. "
  I asked these statistics for a given interval that should be selected by the user. Moreover, the application should also show to the laboratory coordinator the total number of clients and the total number of validated tests that exist in the system.

* > Q:Regarding US16, when the laboratory coordinator "analyses the overall performance of the company", is the analysis purely looking at the results? Or should he write any type of report based on the results for the interval he is seeing?

* >A:You should only identify the time interval where there was a delay in the response (the maximum subsequence).

* > Q:Does the laboratory coordinator also select the amount of working hours per day? Or should we just consider it as 12 working hours/day?

* > A:The lab coordinator does not select the amount of working hours per day. Please consider 12 working hours per day.

* > Q:Should the interval of time considered for the evaluation be asked to the Laboratory Coordinator?

* >  A:Yes.

* > Q:How should we ask him the interval of time to be considered? Should we ask him to type a number of days? A number of weeks? Should we give general options like: last week, last month..., for him to select from?
  In case the Laboratory Coordinator chooses, for example, one week, should we consider the last 7 days, or should we consider, for example, the data from monday to sunday?

* > A:The laboratory coordinator should introduce two dates that define an interval, the beginning date and the end date. This interval will be used to find the contiguous subsequence with maximum sum.

* >Q:What is the meaning of "overview" here? Should the laboratory coordinator see the number of tests waiting for samples, the number of tests waiting for results, the number of tests waiting for diagnoses... Or should he see the information available for each one of the tests in the application?

* > A:The laboratory coordinator should be able to check the number of clients, the number of tests waiting for results, the number of tests waiting for diagnosis and the total number of tests processed in the laboratory in each day, week, month and year. Moreover, the laboratory coordinator should be able to check the contiguous subsequence with maximum sum.
  

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* AC1: The system should show the maximum subsequence for a given interval.
* AC2: There should be displayed graphs for the overview of the company.
* AC3: There need to be tests in the system
* AC4: Start date cannot be later than end date.
* AC5: The laboratory coordinator does not work on sundays and works 12 hours per day.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

*There is a dependency to "US17 -  import clinical tests from a CSV file" since  the report has to contain the data of all tests in the validated state of all many labs laboratories*



### 1.5 Input and Output Data

Input Data 

* Typed data: (none)
  
* Selected data: interval of dates, selects the algorithm of subsequence, graphs.
  
* Output Data: (In)Success of the operation, graphs.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

|                | ...knowing the test to show?                | TestStore              | IE: TestStore contains the tests and its state                                                                |
| Step 2         |                                             |                        |                                                                                                               |
| Step 3         | ...allowing the selection of the test       | ValidateTestUI         | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model. |
| Step 4         |                                             |                        |                                                                                                               |
| Step 5         | ...confirming the data?                     | ValidateTestUI         | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model. |
| Step 6         |                                             |                        |                                                                                                               |
| Step 7         | ...allowing the validation of the test       | ValidateTestUI         | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model. |
| Step 8         | ...informing operation success?            | ValidateTestUI         | IE: is responsible for user interaction                                                                       |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Company


Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* Intervals
* TestStore
* ClientStore
* OverviewController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

![US15-SD](US15-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![US15-CD](US15-CD.svg)

# 4. Tests
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.*



# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*


# 6. Integration and Demo

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*

This user story is related to many user stories, since first of all it is necessary that the Laboratory Coordinator employee is registered in the system, it is also necessary that all the other employees work, so that in the end a test can be validated, thus putting an end to its life cycle.

# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
